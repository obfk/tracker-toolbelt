# Tracker Toolbelt

A number of useful tools for integrating with PivotalTracker.

## Hooks

### `prepare-commit-msg`

If you use a story-ID branch naming convention, this will automatically include the story ID in your commit messages. For example, a branch named `98131919-feature-epicsauce` would have `[#98131919]` appended to the commit message automatically.
